# **Large-Scale Project Organization**

This includes how to structure your project, organize your stacks, and differentiate between stacks and micro stacks. 

**[For more detail](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/using-pulumi/organizing-projects-stacks/)**

## Tradeoffs
Everything described within here is on a spectrum of tradeoffs. Remember that each project is a collection of code, and that each stack is a unit of deployment. Each stack has its own separate configuration and secrets, role-based access controls (RBAC) and policies, and concurrent deployments.

## **Project Structure**

When working on large-scale projects, having a clear and organized project structure is crucial. Here’s how you can structure your Pulumi projects effectively:

- **Modular Design**: Break down your infrastructure into reusable modules. This allows you to define common components (e.g., VPCs, IAM roles) in a single place and use them across different environments or stacks. Modules enhance maintainability and reusability, which are key for scaling.

- **Environment Separation**: Create separate directories or files for different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod). Each environment can have its own configuration while sharing common modules, ensuring consistency across your infrastructure while allowing for environment-specific customizations.

- **Stack Organization**: Organize your stacks based on functionality or team boundaries. For example, you might have separate stacks for networking, security, and application deployment. Each stack should represent a logical grouping of resources that can be managed independently.

## **Stack and Micro Stack Differentiation**

As your infrastructure grows, you may need to further break down your stacks into micro stacks to manage complexity:

- **Stack Size and Scope**: A stack should be large enough to encapsulate a complete piece of functionality but small enough to remain manageable. If a stack becomes too large, consider splitting it into micro stacks.

- [**Micro Stacks**](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/using-pulumi/organizing-projects-stacks/#micro-stacks): Micro stacks are smaller, more focused stacks that handle a specific part of your infrastructure. For example, instead of having a single stack for all networking resources, [you might create micro stacks for different regions or availability zones](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/using-pulumi/organizing-projects-stacks/#moving-from-a-monolithic-project-structure-to-micro-stacks). This approach allows for finer-grained control and can reduce the blast radius of changes.

- **Dependency Management**: When working with multiple stacks and micro stacks, it’s important to manage dependencies carefully. Use Pulumi’s [stack references](https://www.pulumi.com/tutorials/building-with-pulumi/stack-references/) to allow stacks to share outputs and inputs, ensuring that your infrastructure remains consistent and connected.

## **Scalability Considerations**

Organizing your project and stacks effectively is key to scalability. Here are some additional considerations:

- **Team Collaboration**: Design your project structure to facilitate collaboration among teams. Use version control and branching strategies that allow multiple teams to work on different parts of the infrastructure simultaneously without conflicts.

- **Automated Testing**: Implement automated tests for each stack to ensure that changes can be deployed confidently at scale. This includes unit tests for individual components and integration tests that validate the interactions between different stacks.

- **Stack Promotion**: Establish clear processes for promoting stacks from development to production. This may include creating separate stacks for each environment and using continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the promotion process.

## **Conclusion**

Effective project and stack organization are critical for managing large-scale infrastructures with Pulumi. By adopting a modular design, carefully organizing stacks and micro stacks, and considering scalability, you can build a resilient and maintainable infrastructure that grows with your needs.
